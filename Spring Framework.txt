Why Spring?
Spring makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Spring’s focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity has made it the world's most popular Java framework.

Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. 
Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.


Spring Framework Architecture
The Spring framework consists of seven modules which are shown in the above Figure. 
These modules are Spring Core, Spring AOP, Spring Web MVC, Spring DAO, Spring ORM, Spring context, and Spring Web flow.

What can Spring do?
1.Microservices
Microservice architectures are the ‘new normal’. Building small, self-contained, ready to run applications can bring great flexibility and added resilience to your code. 
Spring Boot’s many purpose-built features make it easy to build and run your microservices in production at scale. And don’t forget, no microservice architecture is complete without 
Spring Cloud ? easing administration and boosting your fault-tolerance.
